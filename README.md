Sprint Review and Retrospective  

I will ask user's what they desire and ask questions to get a clear objective on what they need. Once we know what they need, we turn these into user stories to use in our Sprints.  
User Stories ensure the Development Team knows what their code should do. If user stories are not clear enough, the team can ask the product owner for clarification. Which ensures the user the best experience
possible.  

Approach developing programs knowing the problem you want to solve and what the stakeholders and users desire. I hope to incorporate Sprints in my future development work. To ask the product owner for
clarification when needed and to utilize the daily standup meetings.   

To me, being a good team member in software development is doing your work, asking help when you need it, and helping other team members when they need it. Being proactive by asking questions for my development
team when we need clarification or require more resources.
